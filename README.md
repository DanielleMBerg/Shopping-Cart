# Shopping-Cart
Allows you to shop for 4 items, add and remove from cart and restock the store.

I was given starter code from my MIT course which I then completed refactored. All of the CSS and JSX is my code.

# How to Run
To run on your own device, download all the files (except for the LICENSE file and the README file) and save them in one folder. Open your terminal, navigate to the folder, run http-server.

# Future Improvements
A few improvments that I forsee are: seperating the code into individual component files, changing the cart contents to show up in a drop down menu from the cart button (similar to Amazon), activating the checkout function, and updating stock in Strapi live.

# License
See the attached LICENSE file.
